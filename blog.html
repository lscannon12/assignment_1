               <strong>Challenges / Solutions: </strong>
               I found this assignment to be a great refresher on boilerplate html, and especially liked the emphasis on well-structured and semantic
               html. And therein was the challenge: I hadn't previously thought
               critically about how to structure my html. Usually, I just throw stuff at the page until it looks good regardless
               of screen readers. For this assignment, I used a series of bolded paragraph tags
               and  header. I'm still not sure if this is the best structure I could have used;
               would list have been semantically better? Regardless, I think overall it's relatively intuitive.

               <strong>What Did You Learn?: </strong>
               Ever since I've started learning how to code, Git has absolutely baffled me. It gets me so bad that I
               would be remissed to not consider that Linus Torvalds has a personal vendetta against me.
               Like, I'm gonna be walking home from the Opera one night with my son and wife and
               Linus is going to try and burglarize us, potentially leaving my son as a
               rich vigilante on a mission to save the city. <br>
               Regardless, using Git-It and profuse note and "cheat-sheet" taking, I was able to really Git a handle
               on the whole thing. I've got far, far to go. But Mr.Torvald's creation appears to stand less of a chance against me.

               <strong>Resources Used: </strong>
               As always, stack overflow helps considerably. For the most part, though, I took some boilerplate code that
               I never seem to be able to remember ('doctype html, html lang =, most of the stuff in head') and didn't use many
               resources beyond that.
