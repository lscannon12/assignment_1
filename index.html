   <strong>Best Thing I've Done With Web Dev: </strong>A while back, I tried to code a site that really felt
   'alive'; ie, everything moved and the whole site was as interactive as possible. Now, however,
   I'm developing a website that statistically shows how safe someone is in a certain area based on their demograph.
   The site will hopefully also work for the arrest rate of an area, or how likely you are to be arrested based on Your
   demograph in a zipcode.

   <strong>What I hope to learn: </strong>I'm really excited to learn and sharpen the fundamentals
   of web dev!

   <strong>Most interesting thing about me: </strong> I'm a professional bear fighter in Anchorage, and a founding member of the
